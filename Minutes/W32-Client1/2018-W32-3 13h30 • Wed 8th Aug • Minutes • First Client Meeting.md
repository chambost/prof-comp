## Overview of project deliverables
- [MD] Explaination of agile/scrum methodology
  - Stories: what the client wants. Stories are broken into Tasks, completed during Sprints.
- [MD] First Sprint (due Wed 22nd Aug): scope of work (**SoW**); acceptance tests; audit of skills; risk register.
  - [AC] The key input we need today from [CSS] is regarding the **SoW**, what exactly is required to be delivered. As SoW needs to be signed off by [CSS], we would give you early revisions for you to propose amendments to. Ideally this iteration process will result in a **SoW** that [CSS] approves well in advance of the formal due date.
  - [MD] Draft **SoW** will be provided to [CSS] by Wednesday next week (15th)
    
- [MD] Second Sprint (due 17th Sep): prototype
  - [JW] How much input are you as developers supposed to have? How much would you like to have? Because [CSS] is open to that.
    - [AC] Personal interest in voice-interface

## Questions and Answers
- [PE] How will you work as group?
  - [MD] Assign tasks to subgroups
    - [PE] Internally based on skils?
  - [AC] There is a requirement for us to shift between roles
  - [PE] You may want to use this as an opportunity to enhance skills each of you need to work on

- [PE] What are your expectations?

- [PE] How often is the result a prototype, which then has months of feature 
  - [AC] Even Facebook, a top 10 company worldwide by market cap, is still iterating on and improving the product they launched over a decade ago. 
  - [DY]

## Features
### Key feature: enter survey data 
- [CSS] Survey is specified in Carney et al., 
- [CSS] Questions Q1-10 are essential, Q11-15 would be desirable.

### Platform
- [CSS] Ideally both iOS and Android, (web access is tertiary)
- [CSS] First iOS as all the [CSS] internal testers have iOS.

### Audience
- [CSS] Adults, not children.

### [~+30] Light Sensor
- [PE] 
  - [ALL] **Consensus reached** that using the light sensor violates [CSS]'s sleep hygiene policy of no electronic devices in the bedroom. Hence any thought on using this sensor will only be considered further as a possible stretch goal once core functionality is delivered.

### Data 
- [MD] Do you want users to be able to change data days later?
  - [CSS] No.
  - [AC] If you allow people to change data, keep timestamps of changes and retain historic data 

### Voice interface
- [JW] Go for it.
